    <span class="text">Activated Collectibles
Unless the player has (in Afterbirth † and Repentance) Schoolbag, only one activated item can be held at a time, with the old collectible being placed on a pedestal if a new activated item is picked up. Most activated items need to recharge before use, with the recharge bar filling either by clearing rooms or recharging over time. Other activated items do not have a charge bar, and, with a few exceptions (such as How to Jump), will instead either disappear after a single use or require resources such as coins or health. Some activated items will also grant passive effects as long as they are equipped.

(in Repentance) In some special circumstances, activated items can be placed in the consumable slot instead of the standard activated item slot. This counts as both an extra activated item slot and an extra consumable slot, meaning that other activated items and consumables can be picked up as normal. Items in this slot are used with the consumable key, and can't be lost through any means (unless they're consumed like items from (in Repentance) Dice Bag). Otherwise, they function the same as other activated items.</span>
